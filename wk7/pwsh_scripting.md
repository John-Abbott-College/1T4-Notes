# Scripting with PowerShell

So far we have only used commands individually, one at a time. The power of a command line shell comes from the ability to run several commands in a row.

> A script is a text file that contains multiple shell commands that can be executed sequentially.
>
> In **PowerShell specifically**, a script is a simple`` text file that ends with the **file extension .ps1**

To illustrate this, open Notepad and add the following:

```powershell
Write-Host "Hello World!"
```

When saving the file, choose any name but make sure to save it with the extension .ps1

*Note: make sure you have "File name extensions" enabled in File Explorer, otherwise you cannot modify the file extension and your final file name will be script_name.ps1.txt* 

<br>
Then open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where you saved your script. 

## Running Scripts

To run the script specify the file path to the file (relative or absolute):

```powershell
PS C:\Somewhere> .\script_name.ps1
```

If the file path to the script contains an empty space, you must invoke it with the symbol  `&` (the ["call" or "invocation" operator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_operators?view=powershell-7#call-operator-)) followed by the file name.
 
```powershell
PS C:\Somewhere> & '.\script with spaces.ps1'
```

<br>

If you get a `SecurityError` due to `UnauthorizedAccess` , this means that PowerShell tried to execute your file but PowerShell has not been setup to run unknown scripts.

>  This is a security feature done by design and you must bypass it by modifying your **Execution Policy**

Microsoft has chosen to not let users run scripts by default because an un-informed user could accidentally run a malicious script.

## PowerShell Variables

It is possible to use variables in PowerShell by using the `$` (dollar sign).

To assign a value to a variable, we use the `=` operator. To display the value of a variable, simply enter the variable.

You can perform arithmetic operations over numbers:

<br>

It is also possible to store strings inside variables by wrapping words in " " (double quotes).

Two or more string variables can be combined with the "+" operator.
