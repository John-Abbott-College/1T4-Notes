## Styles: Automated Formatting

MS Word allows for a multitude of formatting possibilities.

If the document is large with many sections, it can be very hard to keep track of the different formatting settings used in every element. **This makes it time consuming to create a consistent document.**

Using the Styles feature of Word automated the formatting task and helps create consistent documents.
